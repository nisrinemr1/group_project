# group_project

This file is going to get all my group project that I've participated.

The Plant-chi Project and Daily relaxation are the project that I've participated during my formation at interface 3. 
  - Plant-chi is my first group project and we had to use the programmation languages that we've learned (Html, css, JavaScript and Php). It's a game about learning how to care a plant to keep it alive!
  - Daily Relaxation is a project made during the Hackathon of 3 days at interface 3. It's a relaxing game with kitties. The goal of the game is to be focused on the 3 kitties white, brown and white and keeping your eyes on them even when they became grey. Try to find them!
